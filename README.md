# ama-migration
This repository will provide step by step process to move from MMA to AMA.

**WHY move to AMA -
**
	- Current agents (MMA, OMA or Log Analytics) are going to be deprecated after 31st Aug 2024. 
	- Any services that are currently leveraging MMA won't be supported.
	- MS recommends to move to the AMA agent to leverage the feature to collect Granular as compared to collect all. 
	- AMA uses Managed Identity which is more secure. 
  - Provides better performance as compared to the legacy agents.
